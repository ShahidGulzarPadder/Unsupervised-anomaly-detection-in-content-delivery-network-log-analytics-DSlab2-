Web access logs are generated each time when we visit any website on internet. These contain various important information like IP address, data transferred, timestamp etc. Behaviour of clients/customers can be understood by these logs generated on server. In other words these provide us information about various processes/actions. In our study we are implementing Isolation forest and Local Outlier Factor algorithms for anomaly detection in CDNs.
